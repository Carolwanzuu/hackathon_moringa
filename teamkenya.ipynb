Spine radiology specialists from the ASNR and ASSR provided expert image level annotations these studies to indicate the presence, vertebral level and location of any cervical spine fractures.\n","\n","In this challenge competition, you will try to develop machine learning models that match the radiologists' performance in detecting and localizing fractures to the seven vertebrae that comprise the cervical spine. Winners will be recognized at an event during the RSNA 2022 annual meeting.\n","```\n","\n",">---\n","\n","### Metrics of Success\n","```text\n","Submissions are evaluated using a weighted multi-label logarithmic loss. Each fracture sub-type is its own row for every exam, and you are expected to predict a probability for a fracture at each of the seven cervical vertebrae designated as C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7. There is also an any label, patient_overall, which indicates that a fracture of ANY kind described before exists in the examination. Fractures in the skull base, thoracic spine, ribs, and clavicles are ignored. The any label is weighted more highly than specific fracture level sub-types.\n","\n","For each exam Id, you must submit a set of predicted probabilities (a separate row for each cervical level subtype). We then take the log loss for each predicted probability versus its true label.\n","\n","The binary weighted log loss function for label j on exam i is specified as:\n","\n","Finally, loss is averaged across all rows.\n","\n","There will be 8 rows per image Id. The label indicated by a particular row will look like [image Id]_[Sub-type Name], as follows. There is also a target column, fractured, indicating the probability of whether a fracture exists at the specified level. For each image ID in the test set, you must predict a probability for each of the different possible sub-types and the patient overall.
